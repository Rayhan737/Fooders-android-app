Step 1
Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl until no lumps remain. Add milk, eggs, and oil; whisk until batter is runny and well mixed.

Step 2
Heat a nonstick griddle over medium heat and lightly spray with cooking spray. Pour in a portion of the batter. Cook until bubbles form, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn and cook, pressing middle gently with the spatula, until lightly browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes more. Repeat with the remaining batter.
